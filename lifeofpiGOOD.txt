Inside the ship, there were noises. Deep structural groans. I stumbled and fell. No
harm done. I got up. With the help of the handrails I went down the stairwell four
steps at a time. I had gone down just one level when I saw water. Lots of water. It
was blocking my way. It was surging from below like a riotous crowd, raging, frothing
and boiling. Stairs vanished into watery darkness. I couldn't believe my eyes. What
was this water doing here? Where had it come from? I stood nailed to the spot,
frightened and incredulous and ignorant of what I should do next. Down there was
where my family was.
I ran up the stairs. I got to the main deck. The weather wasn't entertaining any more.
I was very afraid. Now it was plain and obvious: the ship was listing badly. And it
wasn't level the other way either. There was a noticeable incline going from bow to
stern. I looked overboard. The water didn't look to be eighty feet away. The ship was
sinking. My mind could hardly conceive it. It was as unbelievable as the moon
catching fire.
Where were the officers and the crew? What were they doing? Towards the bow I
saw some men running in the gloom. I thought I saw some animals too, but I
dismissed the sight as illusion crafted by rain and shadow. We had the hatch covers
over their bay pulled open when the weather was good, but at all times the animals
were kept confined to their cages. These were dangerous wild animals we were
transporting, not farm livestock. Above me, on the bridge, I thought I heard some
men shouting.
The ship shook and there was that sound, the monstrous metallic burp. What was it?
Was it the collective scream of humans and animals protesting their oncoming
death? Was it the ship itself giving up the ghost? I fell over. I got to my feet. I looked
overboard again. The sea was rising. The waves were getting closer. We were
sinking fast.
